Instructions for Linux users (auditee role) installing into Firefox 29.0.

Step 1: Use "Download Zip" on github (or clone) and install the tlsnotary project into any chosen directory, we'll call it "dir1".

Step 2: Shut down Firefox and make sure no Firefox process is running.

Step 3: Check that you have a /usr/lib/firefox/ directory, containing the file libssl3.so. If not, this patch will not work without further edits to the script (assuming it works at all). In this directory, copy the two files libssl3.so and libsoftokn3.so to some other backup directory.

Step 4: Go into dir1\tlsnotary\data\libraries\ and find the THREE files libssl3.so, libsoftokn3.so and libsqlite3.so. Verify the gpg signatures using "gpg --verify <libname>.asc <libname>" (you need to install gpg of course). The signature should correspond to key ID E9A3197A.

Step 5: Once the signatures are verified, use sudo to copy these three files into /usr/lib/firefox/.

Step 6. You can test by running python tlsnotary-auditee.py (from dir1/tlsnotary)

Step 7: If all is well, you will see a webpage with a "Connect to IRC" button on it. Next, open a new tab and go to : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/ and click "Add to Firefox". Once it is installed, go to the "Open Menu" (the three horizontal lines button on the top right), click it and click "Customize". You should see on the left two grey buttons "RECORD" and "STOP" next to each other. Carefully (wait for the hand icon) drag the RECORD button (the STOP will follow it) onto the x in the bottom left corner, and then drop. You should now "Exit customize" and see the RECORD and STOP buttons in the AddonBar.

tlsnotary should now operate normally.
